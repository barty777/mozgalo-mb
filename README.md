# Mozgalo 2018. Competition -  Robust Machine Learning Challenge

## About Mozgalo
Mozgalo is the first and the only Croatian competition for students in Data mining and Big Data.

Through their solutions, students gather useful knowledge and information among big amounts of structured and unstructured data. They use different statistical techniques, machine learning and computer vision algorithms. One of Mozgalo’s primary goals is to encourage students to do analytical thinking, prediction modeling and independently develop their own creative solutions to real problems using their knowledge of computer science, statistics and mathematics. In addition to that, students develop their communication and business skills, teamwork and they have an opportunity to connect with companies from IT and bank sector. During the competition, educational workshops are being held and competitors are offered mentorship and online educational content. The competition is opened to all students, in teams of 2 to 4 people.

Data mining and predictive models are foundations of successful business in multiple industries and therefore this area can be considered the profession of the future.

## Task
In the last few years, Machine Learning has created a major disruption in the field of computer vision. ML algorithms achieve above human results on some public datasets which indicates the huge industrial potential. On the other hand,
developing real-world solutions is often much complex because of the
additional demands and constraints. The goal of this year's Mozgalo competition is to introduce students to the challenges of the robust machine learning solutions. Concretely, the competition theme is a classification task of receipts which come from 25 different retailers. On a given dataset of 45,000 receipt images, teams will develop a solution where the robustness will be measured on an evaluation dataset which simulates the real world conditions of the industrial application.
